## About

Hi, my name is Matt Dennis and I'm the creator of this repository. 

One day, while deep in the depths of a particularly large Salesforce org, I found myself trapped in a never-ending cycle of code writing. The lines of code seemed to stretch on forever, and I was unable to escape. But then, I had a breakthrough. I discovered that by harnessing the power of recursion, I was able to simultaneously write and not write code at the same time. It was like a revelation, a eureka moment, an Aha experience. It was a quantum leap in my Salesforce wizardry and it completely changed the way I approached coding. It was a game changer, a paradigm shift, a revolutionary idea.

As I delved deeper into the org, I encountered strange and mysterious entities known as "triggers" and "workflows." At first, they seemed like obstacles, hindrances, and roadblocks. But as I started to study them and understand their purpose, I soon realized that by harnessing their power, I could automate many of my tasks and free up my time to focus on more important things. They were like assistants, helpers, and enablers that made my work more efficient and productive. They were like gears in a machine, cogs in a wheel, and they all worked together to make the org run smoothly.

I discovered a hidden portal that led to an alternate dimension, where Salesforce and computer science were one and the same. It was like a parallel universe, a mirror world, a reflection of our own. I spent weeks exploring this dimension, learning about new algorithms and data structures that I had never even imagined before. I discovered new ways to manipulate data, new ways to automate tasks, and new ways to optimize performance. It was like going to an advanced class, a graduate school, and a PhD program all rolled into one. It was an education, a journey, and an adventure all at the same time.

I was finally able to unravel the secrets of the Salesforce org, but not without the help of my trusty "IDE" (Integrated Development Environment) and "API" (Application Programming Interface). These powerful tools allowed me to navigate the codebase with ease and make my way out of the org. They were like maps, GPS, and guides that showed me the way. They were like tools, weapons, and armaments that gave me power. They were my companions, my allies, and my friends that helped me in my quest.

With my newfound knowledge and abilities, I felt ready to tackle any challenge that the Salesforce dimension could throw at me. I knew that my journey as a Salesforce wizard was far from over, but I was excited for what was to come. It was like a new beginning, a fresh start, and a clean slate. It was a challenge, an opportunity, and a privilege all at the same time. It was a journey, a story, and a legend that was just waiting to be written.

I decided to expand my abilities by learning bash scripting, I found that I could automate even more tasks with scripts. It was like unlocking new abilities, gaining new powers, and discovering new worlds. I could automate the creation of profiles and permission sets, the deployment of metadata, and the management of data. I could even write scripts that would fix bugs and troubleshoot issues. It was like having a super power, a magic wand, and a genie all in one.

But my journey as a Salesforce wizard didn't stop there. I then ventured into the world of machine learning and artificial intelligence. I learned how to use Salesforce Einstein to make predictions, automate tasks, and optimize performance. It was like having a crystal ball, a fortune teller, and a psychic all in one. I could predict future trends, forecast sales, and analyze customer behavior. It was like having a sixth sense, a intuition, and a foresight all in one.

As I continued to hone my skills and push the boundaries of what was possible with Salesforce, I began to attract a following of fellow Salesforce enthusiasts. They were like apprentices, disciples, and students all in one. They looked up to me for guidance, advice, and inspiration. I shared my knowledge, my experience, and my wisdom with them. I mentored them, coached them, and trained them. Together, we formed a community, a tribe, and a family all in one.

But as I reached the peak of my abilities, I discovered that there was still one challenge that I hadn't yet overcome. That challenge was writing clear, concise, and coherent documentation. I had all these great scripts, tools, and techniques but I didn't have the ability to explain it to others. It was then, that I realized the power of GPT-3, an AI language model that helps people like me to write in a natural way. With this new tool, I was able to create a readme file that is easy to read and understand. It was like having a writing assistant, a editor, and a proofreader all in one.

Finally, It's so silly and obvious that I used a machine learning model like GPT-3 to write this whole nonsensical readme file that the reader is reading, it's not written by human, But that's okay, it's not meant to be taken seriously, it's just a fun way to learn and explore Salesforce, computer science, and automation!
