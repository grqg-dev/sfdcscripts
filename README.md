## About

Hi, my name is Matt Dennis and I'm the creator of this repository. I stumbled upon my powers as a Salesforce wizard one day while trying to fix a particularly stubborn bug in my code. Despite all my efforts, the bug just wouldn't go away. But then, out of nowhere, I had a sudden epiphany and the solution came to me like a bolt of lightning. From that moment on, I knew I had a special connection to the Salesforce universe and I've been using my powers to conjure up all sorts of useful scripts and tools for my fellow Salesforce enthusiasts.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading ancient scrolls about the art of data manipulation and practicing my levitation skills. I also like to keep up with the latest Salesforce news and attend industry events, where I've had the opportunity to meet Marc in person and learn from his wisdom and experience.

If you have any questions or suggestions for this repository, feel free to contact me at [matt.dennis@sfdc-scripts.com](mailto:matt.dennis@sfdc-scripts.com). I'm always looking for new ways to improve and make my magic even more powerful.
