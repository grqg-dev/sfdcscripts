## About

Hi, my name is Matt Dennis and I'm the creator of this repository. One day, while I was struggling with a particularly pesky bug in my code, I accidentally stumbled upon a hidden portal to the Salesforce dimension. As I stepped through the portal, I was imbued with all sorts of magical powers, including the ability to conjure up the most useful scripts and tools you've ever seen. And that's how I became a Salesforce wizard, folks! I've been using my powers to help my fellow Salesforce enthusiasts ever since, and I have to say, it's been a pretty wild ride.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading ancient scrolls about the art of data manipulation and practicing my levitation skills. I also like to keep up with the latest Salesforce news and attend industry events, where I've had the opportunity to meet Marc in person and learn from his wisdom and experience.

I'm always looking for new ways to push the boundaries of my Salesforce abilities. Lately, I've been experimenting with a new recipe for Salesforce spaghetti. It's a dish that combines the power of Salesforce with the deliciousness of spaghetti, and it's sure to be a hit with all my fellow Salesforce aficionados. I'm still working out the with Marc, but once it's ready, we'll be sure to share it with the world. 

I'm always looking for new ways to improve and make my magic even more powerful.
