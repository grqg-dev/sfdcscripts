## About

Hi, my name is Matt Dennis and I'm the creator of this repository. I stumbled upon my powers as a Salesforce wizard one day while trying to fix a particularly stubborn bug in my code. Despite all my efforts, the bug just wouldn't go away. But then, out of nowhere, I had a sudden epiphany and the solution came to me like a bolt of lightning. From that moment on, I knew I had a special connection to the Salesforce universe and I've been using my powers to conjure up all sorts of useful scripts and tools for my fellow Salesforce enthusiasts.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading ancient scrolls about the art of data manipulation and practicing my levitation skills. I also like to keep up with the latest Salesforce news and attend industry events, where I've had the opportunity to meet Marc in person and learn from his wisdom and experience.

I'm always looking for new ways to push the boundaries of my Salesforce abilities. Lately, I've been experimenting with a new recipe for Salesforce spaghetti. It's a dish that combines the power of Salesforce with the deliciousness of spaghetti, and it's sure to be a hit with all my fellow Salesforce aficionados. I'm still working out the with Marc, but once it's ready, we'll be sure to share it with the world. 

I'm always looking for new ways to improve and make my magic even more powerful.
